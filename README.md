## Usage
Simply enable the plugin and drag and drop the .mdl files into your project directory.  

**Note that some model files have external dependencies such as textures that are stored in a different .mdl file these must be present in your project directory first before import.**

For example suit.mdl has textures stored in suitt.mdl and scientist.mdl has various data stored accross scientistt.mdl, scientist01.mdl, scientist02.mdl, etc...
